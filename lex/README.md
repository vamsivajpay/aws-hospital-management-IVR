ü§ñ Lex Bot Summary
The Lex bot acts as the conversational front-end for the Amazon Connect IVR system.
It prompts callers to specify their reason for calling‚Äîemergency, appointment, or billing‚Äîand routes them accordingly.
The bot leverages ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) to match user utterances to predefined intents, and includes fallback handling for unmatched input.
